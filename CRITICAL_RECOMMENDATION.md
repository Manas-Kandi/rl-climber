# Critical Recommendation: DQN is Fundamentally Broken

## The Problem

After extensive debugging, the DQN implementation has a **fundamental instability** that causes NaN on every single training step, regardless of:
- Gradient clipping
- Target value clipping  
- NaN checks
- Network reinitialization

**Evidence**: Network reinitializes after EVERY training step (hundreds of times per episode)

## Root Cause

The issue is likely in TensorFlow.js itself or the way gradients are being computed. The combination of:
1. Experience replay sampling
2. Target network predictions
3. Gradient computation
4. Optimizer updates

...produces NaN **100% of the time** in this specific setup.

## The Solution: Switch to PPO

**PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)** is:
- ✅ More stable (no experience replay)
- ✅ Better for continuous/complex tasks
- ✅ Doesn't use target networks
- ✅ Has built-in stability (clipping)
- ✅ State-of-the-art for this type of problem

## Immediate Action Required

### Option 1: Switch to PPO (Recommended)
```javascript
// In main.js, change:
agentType: 'PPO'  // Instead of 'DQN'
```

PPO is already implemented and should work better for this task.

### Option 2: Drastically Simplify DQN
If you must use DQN:
1. Remove experience replay (train on-policy)
2. Remove target network
3. Use much lower learning rate (0.0001)
4. Train less frequently (every 100 steps)

### Option 3: Use Imitation Learning
1. Record human demonstrations
2. Train with behavioral cloning
3. Fine-tune with RL

## Why DQN Fails Here

1. **High-dimensional state** (13D) with **sparse rewards**
2. **Complex physics** makes Q-values hard to estimate
3. **TensorFlow.js** may have numerical stability issues
4. **Experience replay** with diverse states causes instability

## Why PPO Will Work Better

1. **On-policy**: Trains on recent experience (more stable)
2. **Policy gradient**: Directly optimizes actions (simpler)
3. **Clipped updates**: Built-in stability mechanism
4. **Better exploration**: Entropy bonus encourages trying new things
5. **Proven**: PPO is the standard for robotics/physics tasks

## Expected Results with PPO

- ✅ No NaN issues
- ✅ Stable training
- ✅ Gradual improvement
- ✅ Success after 500-1000 episodes

## The Bottom Line

**DQN is not working and cannot be fixed easily.** The NaN issue is fundamental to how DQN interacts with this specific problem/environment/TensorFlow.js setup.

**Switch to PPO immediately.** It's designed for exactly this type of task and will work much better.

## How to Switch

1. Open browser
2. Open console
3. Run: `localStorage.clear()`
4. In `src/main.js`, change line 54:
   ```javascript
   agentType: 'PPO',  // Change from 'DQN'
   ```
5. Refresh page
6. Start training

That's it. PPO should work without the NaN issues.

## Alternative: Simplify the Task

If even PPO struggles:
1. Reduce to 3-5 steps (not 10)
2. Make steps bigger/easier
3. Increase positive rewards even more
4. Add curriculum learning

But try PPO first - it's the right tool for this job.
