# NaN Training Bug Fix

## Critical Issue Found

**Problem**: Network produces NaN during training, making learning impossible

**Evidence from diagnostic**:
```
Average loss: NaN
New Q-values: [NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN, NaN]
Q-values changed: false
```

## Root Cause

The DQN training loop had **no gradient clipping** and **no NaN checks**, causing:

1. **Gradient Explosion**: Large rewards/Q-values → huge gradients → NaN weights
2. **No Safety Checks**: Invalid values propagated through network
3. **Cascading Failure**: Once one weight becomes NaN, entire network fails

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Target Value Clipping
```javascript
// Check for NaN/Infinity in inputs
if (!isFinite(reward)) {
  console.error(`Invalid reward at index ${i}: ${reward}`);
  continue;
}
if (!isFinite(maxNextQ)) {
  console.error(`Invalid maxNextQ at index ${i}: ${maxNextQ}`);
  continue;
}

// Clip target value to prevent explosion
targetValue = Math.max(-100, Math.min(100, targetValue));
```

**Purpose**: Prevents extreme target values from causing gradient explosion

### 2. Added Gradient Clipping
```javascript
// Clip gradients to prevent explosion
const clippedGrads = {};
const clipNorm = 1.0;  // Clip gradients to max norm of 1.0

for (const varName in grads.grads) {
  const grad = grads.grads[varName];
  const norm = tf.norm(grad).dataSync()[0];
  if (norm > clipNorm) {
    clippedGrads[varName] = tf.mul(grad, clipNorm / norm);
  } else {
    clippedGrads[varName] = grad;
  }
}

// Apply clipped gradients
this.optimizer.applyGradients(clippedGrads);
```

**Purpose**: Limits gradient magnitude to prevent weight explosion

## Why This Matters

### Before Fix
- Training produces NaN after a few batches
- Network weights become NaN
- All predictions become NaN
- Agent can't learn anything
- Behavior is completely random forever

### After Fix
- Gradients are clipped to safe range
- Target values are bounded
- Invalid values are caught and skipped
- Network weights stay finite
- Agent can actually learn!

## Technical Details

### Gradient Clipping
- **Method**: Global norm clipping
- **Threshold**: 1.0 (conservative)
- **Effect**: Scales down large gradients proportionally

### Target Value Clipping
- **Range**: [-100, +100]
- **Reason**: Matches reward scale (goal = +100)
- **Effect**: Prevents Q-value explosion

### NaN Detection
- Checks rewards and Q-values before use
- Logs errors for debugging
- Skips invalid samples instead of crashing

## Expected Impact

### Immediate
- ✅ No more NaN in training
- ✅ Loss values stay finite
- ✅ Q-values remain reasonable
- ✅ Network weights don't explode

### Long-term
- ✅ Agent can actually learn
- ✅ Q-values converge to true values
- ✅ Policy improves over time
- ✅ Success rate increases

## Testing

Run the diagnostic again:
```bash
node src/diagnose-training.js
```

Expected results:
- ✅ Loss values are finite (not NaN)
- ✅ Q-values change during training
- ✅ Q-values remain in reasonable range
- ✅ Agent shows improvement over episodes

## Related Issues

This fix addresses:
1. **NaN training bug** (critical)
2. **Gradient explosion** (critical)
3. **Q-value divergence** (high)
4. **Training instability** (high)

## Files Modified

- `src/rl/DQNAgent.js` - Added gradient clipping and NaN checks

## Next Steps

1. Run diagnostic to verify fix
2. Clear localStorage (old models have NaN weights)
3. Start fresh training
4. Monitor for:
   - Finite loss values
   - Changing Q-values
   - Improving average reward
   - Increasing success rate

## Notes

- Gradient clipping is **essential** for DQN stability
- Target value clipping prevents Q-value explosion
- NaN checks catch edge cases early
- These are standard practices in deep RL
