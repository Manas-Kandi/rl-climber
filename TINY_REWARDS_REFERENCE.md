## Expected Episode Rewards

### Terrible Episode (stuck on ground, 500 steps)
```
Baseline:     -0.01 √ó 500 = -5.0

**Still negative, but exploring helps**

### Okay Episode (reached Step 0, 300 steps)
```
Baseline:     -0.01 √ó 300 = -3.0

## Debugging with Tiny Rewards

### If avg reward is -15:
‚ùå Agent is completely stuck
‚Üí Check if physics allows movement
‚Üí Increase exploration (entropy)

### If avg reward is -8:
‚ö†Ô∏è Agent is exploring but not learning
‚Üí Increase learning rate
‚Üí Enable curriculum learning

### If avg reward is -2:
‚úÖ Agent is learning! Just needs more time
‚Üí Keep training
‚Üí Watch for Step 0 reaches

### If avg reward is +5:
‚úÖ‚úÖ Agent is doing well!
‚Üí Increase difficulty (curriculum level)
‚Üí Reduce max steps for faster episodes

### If avg reward is +12:
üéâ Agent has mastered the task!
‚Üí Test in live play mode
‚Üí Save the model

## Why This Is Better

### Old System Problems:
- Episode reward: -2495 (meaningless number)
- Can't tell if -2495 is good or bad
- Huge swings make debugging hard
- Network gets confused by scale

### New System Benefits:
- Episode reward: -8 or +5 (clear meaning!)
- Can immediately tell if agent is improving
- Small, consistent rewards
- Network learns stable policy

## The Math

All rewards scaled by **~0.02** (1/50):
- Old: +50 ‚Üí New: +1.0 (50 √ó 0.02)
- Old: -50 ‚Üí New: -1.0 (50 √ó 0.02)
- Old: +100 ‚Üí New: +10.0 (but special case)

**Result:** Same relative importance, but interpretable scale!
