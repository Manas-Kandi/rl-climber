# State Size Fix - Complete

## Problem
State vector was expanded from 9D to 13D, but various parts of the code still had hardcoded 9D values.

## All Fixes Applied

### 1. ClimbingEnvironment.js ✅
- `reset()` error return: `Float32Array(9)` → `Float32Array(13)`
- `step()` error return: `Float32Array(9)` → `Float32Array(13)`
- `getStateSpace()`: Already returns 13 ✅

### 2. main.js ✅
**Agent initialization (3 locations):**
- Initial creation: `new PPOAgent(9, 6)` → `new PPOAgent(13, 6)`
- Agent switching: `new DQNAgent(9, 6)` → `new DQNAgent(13, 6)`
- Agent testing: Both updated to 13

**Test state in testInferenceSpeed:**
- Before: `new Float32Array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9])`
- After: `new Float32Array([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4])`

## State Vector Structure (13D)

```javascript
[
  x,           // 0: Position X (normalized)
  y,           // 1: Position Y (normalized)
  z,           // 2: Position Z (normalized)
  vx,          // 3: Velocity X (normalized)
  vy,          // 4: Velocity Y (normalized)
  vz,          // 5: Velocity Z (normalized)
  distGoal,    // 6: Distance to goal (normalized)
  goalDirZ,    // 7: Goal direction Z (-1 or +1) ← NEW
  goalDirY,    // 8: Goal direction Y (-1 or +1) ← NEW
  currentStep, // 9: Current step number (0-10, normalized)
  distNext,    // 10: Distance to next step (normalized)
  onStairs,    // 11: Binary flag (0 or 1) ← NEW
  buffer       // 12: Safety buffer (0-1, normalized) ← NEW
]
```

## What Changed

### Old 9D State
- Position, velocity, distances
- Agent had to infer goal direction from position
- No explicit feedback about being on stairs
- No urgency signal

### New 13D State
- Everything from 9D, plus:
- **Explicit goal direction** (tells agent which way to go)
- **On-stairs flag** (immediate feedback about location)
- **Safety buffer** (creates urgency to find stairs)

## Benefits

1. **Faster Learning**: Agent doesn't need to learn goal direction from position
2. **Clearer Signals**: Binary on-stairs flag is easier to learn than inferring from position
3. **Urgency**: Buffer countdown creates time pressure to find stairs
4. **Better Exploration**: Agent knows when it's running out of time

## Important Note

**Old saved models won't work!** They were trained on 9D state.

To fix:
1. Open browser console
2. Run: `localStorage.clear()`
3. Refresh page
4. Train new model with 13D state

## Status

✅ All state size mismatches fixed
✅ Agent initialization updated
✅ Test states updated
✅ Error returns updated
✅ Ready to train!

The game should now work without state size errors.
