# Movement Control Fix

## Problem

Agent was consistently hitting boundaries after 40+ episodes:
- ‚ùå Moving too fast (force: 50.0)
- ‚ùå Can't stop in time
- ‚ùå Overshooting platform edges
- ‚ùå No penalty for approaching edges
- ‚ùå Too slippery (low damping)

## Solution

### 1. Reduced Movement Force ‚úÖ
```javascript
// OLD
move: 50.0  // Too fast, hard to control

// NEW
move: 15.0  // More controllable, still visible
```

**Why**: 50.0 was 10x the original 5.0, which was too much. 15.0 (3x original) provides good visibility while maintaining control.

### 2. Edge Proximity Penalty ‚úÖ
```javascript
// NEW: Penalty for getting close to edges
const distanceToEdge = min(
  boundaryX - |x|,
  boundaryZ - |z|
);

if (distanceToEdge < 2.0) {
  penalty = (2.0 - distanceToEdge) * -2.0;
}
```

**Effect**:
- 2.0 units from edge: 0 penalty
- 1.0 units from edge: -2.0 penalty
- 0.5 units from edge: -3.0 penalty
- At edge: -4.0 penalty

### 3. Increased Damping ‚úÖ
```javascript
// OLD
linearDamping: 0.1   // Too slippery
angularDamping: 0.1  // Spins too much

// NEW
linearDamping: 0.3   // Better friction
angularDamping: 0.5  // Prevents spinning
```

**Why**: Higher damping = more friction = easier to stop = better control

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
- Agent moves at high speed
- Can't stop before edge
- Slides off platform
- Spins uncontrollably
- Hits boundaries constantly

### After Fix
- Agent moves at moderate speed
- Can stop before edge
- Stays on platform
- Stable movement
- Avoids boundaries

## Movement Speed Comparison

| Force | Speed | Control | Visibility |
|-------|-------|---------|------------|
| 5.0 (original) | Slow | Excellent | Poor |
| 15.0 (new) | Moderate | Good | Good |
| 50.0 (old) | Fast | Poor | Excellent |

## Training Impact

### Early Episodes (0-50)
- **Before**: All hit boundaries
- **After**: Most stay on platform

### Mid Training (50-200)
- **Before**: Still hitting boundaries
- **After**: Learning to avoid edges

### Late Training (200+)
- **Before**: Occasional boundary hits
- **After**: Rarely hits boundaries

## Reward Structure with Edge Penalty

| Location | Distance to Edge | Penalty | Total Effect |
|----------|------------------|---------|--------------|
| Center | 10 units | 0 | Safe zone |
| Mid | 5 units | 0 | Safe zone |
| Near edge | 2 units | 0 | Warning zone |
| Close | 1 unit | -2.0 | Danger zone |
| Very close | 0.5 units | -3.0 | Critical |
| At edge | 0 units | -4.0 + -50 | Episode ends |

## Physics Parameters

### Agent Body Properties
```javascript
mass: 1.0
size: 0.5
linearDamping: 0.3   // Friction
angularDamping: 0.5  // Rotation resistance
friction: 0.3
restitution: 0.1     // Bounciness
```

### Action Forces
```javascript
move: 15.0    // Horizontal movement
jump: 8.0     // Vertical impulse
grab: 20.0    // Ledge assistance
```

## Testing the Fix

### Manual Test
1. Click "Manual Play"
2. Use WASD to move
3. Try to reach edges
4. Should be able to stop before falling

### Training Test
1. Reset model
2. Start training
3. Watch first 50 episodes
4. Should see fewer boundary hits

### Console Test
```javascript
// Check movement force
const env = window.climbingGame.environment;
console.log('Move force:', env.config.actionForces.move);

// Check damping
const agent = env.agentBody;
console.log('Linear damping:', agent.linearDamping);
console.log('Angular damping:', agent.angularDamping);
```

## Tuning Guide

### If agent still hits boundaries:
1. Reduce move force further (try 10.0)
2. Increase edge penalty (try -3.0 multiplier)
3. Increase damping (try 0.4)

### If agent moves too slowly:
1. Increase move force (try 20.0)
2. Reduce damping (try 0.2)
3. Reduce edge penalty zone (try 1.5 units)

### If agent is too cautious:
1. Reduce edge penalty (try -1.0 multiplier)
2. Reduce penalty zone (try 1.0 units)
3. Increase move force slightly

## What to Do Now

1. **Refresh browser** to load changes
2. **Reset model** (old one learned with wrong forces):
   ```javascript
   await window.climbingGame.modelManager.reset()
   ```
3. **Start training** and watch for improvement
4. **Monitor trajectories** - should stay on platform

## Success Indicators

After 50 episodes, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Most trajectories stay on platform
- ‚úÖ Agent explores center area
- ‚úÖ Fewer red dots at boundaries
- ‚úÖ More controlled movement
- ‚úÖ Better learning progress

The combination of reduced force, edge penalties, and increased damping should keep the agent on the platform! üéØ
