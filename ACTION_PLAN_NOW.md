# Action Plan - What To Do Right Now

## The Problem Was Found

**NaN Training Bug**: Network weights became NaN during training, making learning impossible.

**Root Cause**: No gradient clipping + extreme reward values = gradient explosion = NaN weights

## The Fix Was Applied

âœ… Added gradient clipping (max norm = 1.0)  
âœ… Added target value clipping ([-100, +100])  
âœ… Added NaN/Infinity checks  
âœ… Rebalanced rewards (positive expected value)  
âœ… Fixed physics damping  
âœ… Fixed step detection  

## What To Do Now

### Step 1: Test the Fix (2 minutes)
```bash
node src/diagnose-training.js
```

**Look for**:
- âœ… Loss values are **finite** (not NaN)
- âœ… Q-values **change** during training
- âœ… Q-values stay in reasonable range (not NaN)
- âœ… Some improvement over 20 episodes

### Step 2: Clear Old Models (30 seconds)
Open browser console:
```javascript
localStorage.clear()
```

Old models have NaN weights and won't work.

### Step 3: Start Training (1 hour)
1. Open game in browser
2. Click "Visual Training"
3. Set episodes to 100
4. Click "Start Training"
5. **Watch the console and metrics**

### Step 4: Monitor Progress

**First 10 episodes** - Look for:
- âœ… No "NaN" in console
- âœ… No crashes
- âœ… Average reward > -20 (was -83!)
- âœ… Agent moves (not frozen)

**Episodes 10-50** - Look for:
- âœ… Average reward trending upward
- âœ… Agent moves toward stairs
- âœ… Occasionally reaches step 0 or 1
- âœ… Loss values decreasing

**Episodes 50-100** - Look for:
- âœ… Average reward > 0
- âœ… Agent finds stairs consistently
- âœ… Reaches steps 2-3
- âœ… Clear upward trend

## If It Works

ðŸŽ‰ **Success!** The agent is learning!

Continue training for 300-500 episodes to see:
- Climbing 5-8 steps regularly
- Occasional goal reaches
- Success rate 1-5%

## If It Doesn't Work

### Check 1: Are there NaN values?
If yes â†’ The fix didn't apply. Re-read the files and check DQNAgent.js

### Check 2: Is average reward still -83?
If yes â†’ Agent not exploring. Increase epsilon or simplify task

### Check 3: Is agent frozen/not moving?
If yes â†’ Physics issue. Check freeze diagnostics

### Check 4: Does it crash?
If yes â†’ Share the error message

## Expected Timeline

- **Minutes 0-10**: Random exploration, reward â‰ˆ -20 to -40
- **Minutes 10-30**: Finds stairs occasionally, reward â‰ˆ -10 to +5
- **Minutes 30-60**: Finds stairs consistently, reward â‰ˆ +5 to +15
- **Hour 1-3**: Climbs 2-3 steps, reward â‰ˆ +15 to +30
- **Hour 3-10**: Climbs 5-8 steps, reward â‰ˆ +30 to +60

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Bad | OK | Good | Great |
|--------|-----|----|----|-------|
| Loss | NaN | 10-50 | 1-10 | 0.1-1 |
| Avg Reward | -83 | -20 to 0 | 0 to +20 | +20 to +60 |
| Success Rate | 0% | 0% | 0-1% | 1-10% |
| Highest Step | 0 | 0-1 | 2-4 | 5-10 |

## The Bottom Line

**Before**: NaN bug + bad rewards = no learning possible  
**After**: Stable training + good rewards = learning possible  

**Now**: Just needs time to train!

Run the diagnostic, clear localStorage, and start training. Watch for finite loss values and upward trends. If you see those, it's working! ðŸš€
