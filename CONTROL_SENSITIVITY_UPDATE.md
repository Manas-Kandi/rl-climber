# Control Sensitivity Update

**Date:** October 25, 2025  
**Time:** 14:45 UTC  
**Issue:** WASD controls too insensitive  
**Status:** FIXED ✅

## Problem
User reported that WASD movement controls were too insensitive and requested 50% increase in sensitivity.

## Solution
Increased movement force from 12.0 to 18.0 (50% increase).

## Changes Made

### 1. Main Configuration (`src/main.js`)
```javascript
// BEFORE
actionForces: {
    move: 12.0,  // Previous value
    jump: 10.0,
    grab: 25.0
}

// AFTER  
actionForces: {
    move: 18.0,  // 50% increase (12.0 × 1.5 = 18.0)
    jump: 10.0,  // Unchanged
    grab: 25.0   // Unchanged
}
```

### 2. Test Suite Update (`src/test-freeze-fix.js`)
Updated test expectations to validate the new movement force threshold.

### 3. Documentation Update (`FREEZE_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION.md`)
Updated implementation documentation to reflect the new values.

## Expected Result
- WASD movement should now be 50% more responsive
- Agent should move faster and more noticeably when using manual controls
- Training and auto-play should also benefit from more decisive movement actions

## Testing
Run `window.freezeFixTests.forces()` in browser console to verify the new force values are applied correctly.

## Impact
- **Positive:** Much more responsive manual controls
- **Training:** Agent can explore more effectively with stronger movement
- **Performance:** No negative impact on game performance
