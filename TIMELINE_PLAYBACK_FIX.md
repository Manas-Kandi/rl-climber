# Timeline Playback Fix

## ✅ What Was Fixed

The timeline now properly visualizes and replays episodes!

### Issues Fixed

1. **Agent not moving** - Added `render()` call after position updates
2. **No path visualization** - Implemented Three.js line drawing
3. **Missing visual feedback** - Added console logging for debugging

---

## 🎬 How It Works Now

### When You Click an Episode

1. **Loads trajectory data** from JSON file
2. **Draws cyan path line** showing agent's movement
3. **Positions agent** at starting point
4. **Updates episode info** (reward, steps, status)
5. **Renders the scene** to show everything

### When You Press Play

1. **Advances through steps** at selected speed (0.5x - 4x)
2. **Updates agent position** for each step
3. **Moves camera** to follow agent
4. **Renders each frame** smoothly
5. **Auto-advances** to next episode when done

## 🎨 Visual Features

### Path Line
- **Cyan line** shows agent's complete path
- **Semi-transparent** (60% opacity)
- **Follows all positions** through the episode
- **Cleared** when switching episodes

### Agent Movement
- **Smooth updates** at 60 FPS
- **Camera follows** agent position
- **Real-time rendering** shows movement

### Episode Info
```
Episode: 234
Reward: 10.08
Steps: 156
Status: ❌ Failed
```

## 📊 What You'll See

### Early Episodes (1-200)
- **Random paths** - Agent exploring
- **Short episodes** - Falls quickly
- **Low rewards** - Not making progress
- **Red bars** - Failures

### Middle Episodes (200-800)
- **Learning patterns** - More deliberate movement
- **Longer episodes** - Surviving longer
- **Improving rewards** - Making progress
- **Yellow bars** - Partial success

### Late Episodes (800-1789)
- **Consistent behavior** - Learned strategy
- **Longest episodes** - Reaching higher
- **Best rewards** - Optimized performance
- **Green bars** - Successes

## 💡 Tips for Analysis

### Finding Interesting Episodes

1. **Look for tall bars** - High rewards
2. **Look for green bars** - Successful episodes
3. **Compare early vs late** - See improvement
4. **Watch failures** - Learn what doesn't work

### Understanding Agent Behavior

1. **Watch the path line** - See movement strategy
2. **Observe patterns** - Repeated behaviors
3. **Note decision points** - Where agent chooses actions
4. **Compare strategies** - Different approaches

### Debugging Training

1. **Check if agent explores** - Early episodes should be random
2. **Look for learning** - Rewards should increase
3. **Identify problems** - Where does it fail?
4. **Verify progress** - Is it improving?

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Path Line Drawing
```javascript
// Create points from trajectory steps
const points = steps.map(step => 
    new THREE.Vector3(step.position.x, step.position.y, step.position.z)
);

// Create line geometry
const geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry().setFromPoints(points);

// Create cyan material
const material = new THREE.LineBasicMaterial({
    color: 0x00ffff,
    opacity: 0.6,
    transparent: true
});

// Add to scene
const line = new THREE.Line(geometry, material);
scene.add(line);
```

### Playback Loop
```javascript
// 60 FPS adjusted by speed
const frameTime = 1000 / 60 / playbackSpeed;

setInterval(() => {
    // Get current step
    const step = trajectory.steps[currentStepIndex];
    
    // Update agent
    renderingEngine.updateAgentPosition(step.position);
    renderingEngine.updateCamera(step.position);
    renderingEngine.render();
    
    // Advance
    currentStepIndex++;
}, frameTime);
```

1. Click early episode (e.g., #50)
2. Watch behavior
3. Click late episode (e.g., #1500)
4. Compare strategies

### Find Best Performance
1. Look for tallest green bar
2. Click on it
3. Watch the successful strategy
4. Learn what works!

### Speed Through Training
1. Set speed to 4x
2. Press Play
3. Watch entire training history
4. See learning progression

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Agent not moving
- **Check**: Is trajectory loaded? (Check console)
- **Check**: Is rendering engine available?
- **Fix**: Refresh page and try again

### No path line visible
- **Check**: Does trajectory have steps?
- **Check**: Is Three.js loaded?
- **Fix**: Check browser console for errors

### Playback too fast/slow
- **Solution**: Adjust speed dropdown
- **Options**: 0.5x (slow), 1x (normal), 2x (fast), 4x (very fast)

### Timeline not responding
- **Check**: Are trajectories loaded?
- **Check**: Is metadata.json valid?
- **Fix**: Run training again to regenerate data
