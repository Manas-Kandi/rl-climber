# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a minimalist web-based 3D climbing game where an AI agent learns to climb obstacles using reinforcement learning. The entire system runs in the browser with real-time visualization, allowing users to watch the agent learn and improve its climbing behavior over time. The game uses Three.js for 3D rendering, Cannon-es for physics simulation, and TensorFlow.js for implementing reinforcement learning algorithms (PPO or DQN).
