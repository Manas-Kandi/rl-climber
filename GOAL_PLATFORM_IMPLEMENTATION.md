# Goal Platform Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a proper goal detection system that rewards the agent for reaching the goal platform at the top of the staircase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Goal Platform Detection (`isOnGoalPlatform`)
Added a new method to detect when the agent is standing on the goal platform:
- **Goal position**: `{ x: 0, y: 10.5, z: -20 }`
- **Goal size**: `{ x: 4, y: 0.5, z: 2 }`
- **Detection logic**: Checks if agent is within X/Z bounds and at correct height

### 2. Step Detection Enhancement (`detectCurrentStep`)
Updated to return `10` when agent is on goal platform:
- Steps 0-9: Regular staircase steps
- Step 10: **GOAL PLATFORM** (ultimate success!)

### 3. Reward System Update
**Goal Reached Reward**: +100.0 (massive reward!)
- Immediately terminates episode with success
- Only way to get the maximum reward
- Clear signal that this is the ultimate objective

### 4. Boundary Fix (`isOutOfBounds`)
Fixed Z-axis boundary check:
- **Before**: Used `boundaryZ: 10`, which incorrectly flagged steps 6-9 as out of bounds
- **After**: Allows Z range from `5` to `-22` (covers entire staircase + goal)
- **X bounds**: Still ±10 units (unchanged)

### 5. Terminal Condition Update (`isTerminal`)
Added goal check as first terminal condition:
```javascript
if (currentStep === 10) {
  return true; // SUCCESS!
}
```

### 6. Episode Stats Enhancement (`getEpisodeStats`)
Now properly tracks:
- `success`: True when `currentStep === 10`
- `highestStep`: Tracks progress (0-10)
- `steps`: Number of steps taken
- `totalReward`: Cumulative reward

### 7. State Representation Update (`getState`)
Updated goal position in state vector:
- **Goal position**: `{ x: 0, y: 10.75, z: -20 }` (center of goal platform top)
- Provides accurate distance and direction to goal

## Reward Structure

### Perfect Climb Rewards
Climbing all 10 steps + reaching goal:
1. **Landing on stairs**: +5.0
2. **Climbing step 0→1**: +3.0 + 0.5 = +3.5
3. **Climbing step 1→2**: +3.0 + 0.5 = +3.5
4. **Climbing step 2→3**: +3.0 + 0.5 = +3.5
5. **Climbing step 3→4**: +3.0 + 0.5 = +3.5
6. **Climbing step 4→5**: +3.0 + 0.5 = +3.5
7. **Climbing step 5→6**: +3.0 + 0.5 = +3.5
8. **Climbing step 6→7**: +3.0 + 0.5 = +3.5
9. **Climbing step 7→8**: +3.0 + 0.5 = +3.5
10. **Climbing step 8→9**: +3.0 + 0.5 = +3.5
11. **Reaching goal platform**: +100.0

**Total Perfect Climb Reward**: **137.0**

## Test Results

All tests pass ✅:
- ✅ Ground detection (step -1)
- ✅ Step 0-9 detection
- ✅ Goal platform detection (step 10)
- ✅ Goal platform bounds (center, edges, outside)
- ✅ Goal reward (+100)
- ✅ Terminal condition on goal
- ✅ Success tracking
- ✅ Full episode simulation (137.0 total reward)

## Scene Configuration

The goal platform is defined in `SceneManager.js`:
```javascript
{
  type: 'goal',
  position: { x: 0, y: 10.5, z: -20 },
  size: { x: 4, y: 0.5, z: 2 },
  color: 0x00ff00,  // Green
  id: 'goal'
}
```

## Key Insights

1. **Clear Objective**: Agent now has a clear, detectable end goal
2. **Massive Reward**: +100 makes goal achievement the dominant objective
3. **Proper Termination**: Episode ends immediately on success
4. **No False Penalties**: Fixed boundary checks prevent incorrect out-of-bounds penalties
5. **Progress Tracking**: System tracks highest step reached (0-10)

## Next Steps

The goal system is fully implemented and tested. The agent can now:
- Detect when it reaches the goal platform
- Receive massive reward (+100) for success
- Have episodes properly terminate on goal achievement
- Track progress through all 10 steps + goal

Training should now optimize for reaching the goal platform!
