# Summary of Changes - Staircase Learning Fix

## Problem
The agent was not learning to climb the stairs. It remained stuck in one place with no progress during training.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Unreliable step detection** - Collision-based detection was inconsistent
2. **Weak reward signals** - Not enough incentive to progress
3. **No learning gradient** - Agent couldn't learn intermediate steps
4. **Conflicting rewards** - Different reward components fighting each other

## Files Modified

### 1. `src/rl/ClimbingEnvironment.js`
**Changes:**
- **`detectCurrentStep()`** - Completely rewritten to use position-based detection instead of collision detection
  - Checks agent's (x, y, z) position against known step locations
  - More reliable and consistent
  - Works even when not perfectly touching step

- **`calculateReward()`** - Redesigned reward structure
  - **Primary reward**: +20, +40, +60... for reaching new steps (exponential)
  - **Height reward**: +0.3 per unit height (continuous gradient)
  - **Proximity reward**: Up to +1.0 for being near next step (guidance)
  - **On-step bonus**: +0.5 per timestep on any step (encouragement)
  - **Penalties**: -0.5 for off-center, -0.01 per timestep, -50 for falling/OOB
  - Removed conflicting reward components

- **`reset()`** - Improved initialization
  - Better velocity reset including angular velocity
  - Cleaner logging

- **`updateStartPosition()`** - New method
  - Allows updating agent start position when switching scenes

### 2. `src/training/TrainingOrchestrator.js`
**Changes:**
- **`runEpisodeDQN()`** - Added step tracking to return value
  - Now returns `highestStep` and `currentStep` in episode result
  
- **`runEpisodePPO()`** - Added step tracking to return value
  - Now returns `highestStep` and `currentStep` in episode result

### 3. `src/ui/UIController.js`
**Changes:**
- **`setupDOMReferences()`** - Added new stat elements
  - `statCurrentStep` - Shows current step agent is on
  - `statHighestStep` - Shows highest step reached this episode

- **`updateStepTracking()`** - New method
  - Updates step display in UI
  - Shows "Ground", "Step N", or "Goal"

- **Episode callback** - Updated to call `updateStepTracking()`
  - Now receives and processes `episodeResult` parameter

### 4. `index.html`
**Changes:**
- Added two new stat displays in stats panel:
  - "Current Step" - Real-time step position
  - "Highest Step" - Best progress this episode

### 5. `src/main.js`
**Changes:**
- Reduced movement force from 15.0 to 8.0 for better staircase control
- Added import for `test-rewards.js`

### 6. New Files Created

#### `src/test-rewards.js`
- Comprehensive test script for reward system
- Run with: `testRewards(window.climbingGame)`
- Tests:
  - Start position verification
  - Step detection at all positions
  - Reward calculation for climbing
  - Continuous reward gradient
  - Action effects (movement)

#### `REWARD_SYSTEM_FIX.md`
- Detailed documentation of reward structure
- Explains each reward component
- Provides examples and expected values
- Includes testing instructions

#### `STAIRCASE_LEARNING_FIX.md`
- Complete guide to the fix
- Root cause analysis
- Solution explanation
- Expected training behavior
- Troubleshooting guide

#### `REWARD_TUNING.md` (if exists)
- Additional reward tuning documentation

## Key Improvements

### 1. Reliable Step Detection
```javascript
// Old: Collision-based (unreliable)
for (const body of collidingBodies) {
  if (bodyId.startsWith('step_')) return stepNum;
}

// New: Position-based (reliable)
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  if (agentPos.z >= stepMinZ && agentPos.z <= stepMaxZ &&
      heightDiff < 1.5) {
    return i;
  }
}
```

### 2. Clear Reward Structure
```javascript
// Step rewards: 20, 40, 60, 80, 100...
const stepReward = (currentStep + 1) * 20.0;

// Height gradient: 0.3 per unit
const heightReward = agentPos.y * 0.3;

// Proximity to next step: up to 1.0
const proximityReward = Math.max(0, 2.0 - distToNextStep) * 0.5;

// On-step bonus: 0.5 per timestep
if (currentStep >= 0) totalReward += 0.5;
```

### 3. Visual Feedback
- Real-time step tracking in UI
- Shows current position and best progress
- Helps monitor learning progress

## Expected Results

### Training Progress
- **Episodes 1-50**: Learning basic movement, reaching Steps 0-1
- **Episodes 50-200**: Consistently reaching Steps 2-4
- **Episodes 200-500**: Reaching Steps 5-9, approaching goal
- **Episodes 500+**: Consistently reaching goal

### Reward Growth
- **Early**: 0-30 range
- **Mid**: 30-100 range
- **Late**: 100-300 range
- **Mastery**: 300-500 range

## Testing

### 1. Run Reward Test
```javascript
testRewards(window.climbingGame)
```
Verifies:
- ✅ Start position correct (0, 1, 3)
- ✅ Step detection working
- ✅ Rewards increasing with progress
- ✅ Actions moving agent correctly

### 2. Monitor Training
Watch for:
- Episode rewards increasing
- Highest step reached growing
- Console logs showing "NEW STEP X!"
- UI showing step progress

### 3. Check Metrics
After 50 episodes:
- Average reward > 20
- Max reward > 50
- Highest step ≥ 2

After 200 episodes:
- Average reward > 50
- Max reward > 150
- Highest step ≥ 5

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fix**: Run `testRewards(window.climbingGame)`
2. **Start training**: Click "Start Training" button
3. **Monitor progress**: Watch episode rewards and step tracking
4. **Adjust if needed**: Fine-tune reward weights based on results

The agent should now learn progressively, with clear feedback at each step!
